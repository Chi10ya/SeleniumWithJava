Zalenium - Setting up auto scalling selenium grid on Docker containers - On YT - By QA Fox
=============================================================================================


Though we can setup selenium grid on docker by ourselves, but we can choose Zalenium for Selenium Grid setup for its advantages
The below are the advantages of Setting up Selenium Grid using Zalenium

	> Automnatic scaling up and down of Docker Containers on Need basis
	> Live Previews
	> Dashboard
	> Parallel execution of scripts is possible
	

Pre-Requisite
	> Docker is installed
		> Downloading and installing Docker
			> Pre-req : Windows 10 64 bit or higher
				(Type winver in windows search and check the windows version)
				
			> Pre-req : Minimum 4 GB RAM
			
			> Pre-req : BIOS - Level Virtualization is enabled

					> Instructions for starting Zalenium
					
						This is the quick start for the docker version,
						
							# Pull docker-selenium image
    								docker pull elgalu/selenium
    
   							# Pull Zalenium image
    								docker pull dosel/zalenium
    
    						# Run it! (If any \ exists in the below command, remove it and make the command in a single line as below stated)
    								docker run --rm -ti --name zalenium -p 4444:4444 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/videos:/home/seluser/videos --privileged dosel/zalenium start
      
    						# Point your tests to http://localhost:4444/wd/hub and run them

    						# Stop
    							docker stop zalenium
							
					> Grid, Console and Live Preview links to check once the Zalenium is up
							Grid Console : https://localhost:4444/grid/console
							Grid Dashboard : https://localhost:4444/dashboard
							Grid Live Privew : https://localhost:4444/grid/admin/live
								
				> Running the automation scripts on Zalenium
					Firefox
					Chrome
						> Workaround for Chrome - options.addArguments("--disable-dev-shm-usage");
					Parallel Execution of more than 2 tests for watching Auto-scaling feature of Zalenium
